Certainly! Here's an example of a README file you can use for your project:

# Chess Library

This is a C++ library for assessing positions in a game of chess. It provides classes for handling chess-related concepts such as coordinates, pieces, squares, and the chess board. The library allows you to create and manipulate chess positions, calculate possible moves for different pieces, and evaluate the state of the game.

## Classes

The library consists of the following classes:

1. Coordinates: Represents the coordinates of a square on the chess board.
2. Piece: Base class for different chess pieces, with subclasses for each piece type.
3. Square: Represents a square on the chess board, storing its coordinates and the piece occupying it.
4. Board: Represents the chess board, composed of squares.

## Usage

To use the chess library in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header files in your source files.
2. Implement the missing methods and logic in each class according to your requirements.
3. Compile all the source files together, including your main program file, using a C++ compiler.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how you can use the chess library:

```cpp
#include "board.h"
#include "knight.h"

int main() {
    // Create a chess board
    Board board(8, 8);

    // Create a knight piece
    Coordinates knightCoordinates(2, 'b');
    Knight knight("Knight", knightCoordinates, Piece::NAME_WHITE, &board);

    // Calculate possible moves for the knight
    Coordinates** possibleMoves;
    int numMoves = knight.possibleMoves(possibleMoves);

    // Display the possible moves
    for (int i = 0; i < numMoves; i++) {
        std::cout << "Move: " << possibleMoves[i]->getColumn() << possibleMoves[i]->getRow() << std::endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory
    for (int i = 0; i < numMoves; i++) {
        delete possibleMoves[i];
    }
    delete[] possibleMoves;

    return 0;
}
```
